//r is for Read Caps, and it's simply like the username, the part before the '@'-sign in an unhosted address
//c is for Cloud, the domain name of the unhosted server
//n is RSA's name for the public key (e=0x10001). Ever heard of RSA being large primes multiplied? There you go: n=p*q.
//s is for session key. Again, RSA terminology. It's the access token you share to a groud of friends or subscribers
