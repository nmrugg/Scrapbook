This is my entry for the [Unhosted Hacky Holidays contest](http://www.unhosted.org/HackyHolidays.html).  You will need an [Unhosted cloud server](https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted) in order to save your work.

Right now, it is basically alpha quality, but I plan to continue developing it.
